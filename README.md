# REPO: TheDrawingBoard_WebApp
# PROJECT NAME: Collaborative Drawing Website

Welcome to our collaborative drawing website! This platform is designed to bring together artists from all over the world, allowing them to draw on a virtual whiteboard. It's a place where creativity can be shared, ideas can be exchanged, and new artistic experiences can be created.

## Features

* Weekly Voted Prompts: Each week, we'll provide a new library of words for the community to build their own prompt with. These prompts can then be voted on by the community, and the winning prompt becomes the guidelines for next weeks art session!

* Power-Ups: We offer a variety of power-ups that can be used to unlock more creative tools! These include: The Bucket Tool, Copy-Pasting, Eraser, Glitter, Move Selection, Permanent Marker, and more. Use them wisely and creatively to enhance everyones drawings, or wreak havoc!

* Archive of Previous Artwork: We've got an archive of each weeks' community-made art piece created on our platform. You can browse through it to get inspiration, see what others have created, and even download for personal use.

## How to Use

* Join the Community: We made no bariers to joining in on the fun, come right in! You will be given a unique user-ID to keep track of your brush strokes, what weeks you participated in, and what power-ups you have, but thats it.

* Choose a Prompt: Once you're part of the community, you can vote on prompts for next week, as well as build your own.

* Start Drawing: Use your chosen tools to start drawing on the virtual whiteboard. You can draw anything you want, but try to incorporate the prompt into your drawing.

* Use Power-ups: Every week you get one power-up for free! You can use them to enhance your drawing, help others, or cause a ruckus! Just click on the power-up buttons in your toolbar and select the tool you want to use.

* View the Archive: To see all the art that's been created on our platform, go to the Archive page. You can browse through it, and even leave comments on art you participated in. [See Stretch Goal Section]
